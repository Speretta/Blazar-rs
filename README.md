# Blazar-rs
A fully Rust Minecraft server implementation that I developed mostly for educational purposes.

## Why
The Minecraft server ecosystem is mostly built on Java. I miss Rust a lot when writing Spigot plugins. And I thought, why not a Minecraft server with Rust? There are actually quite a few Rust implementations. It was a project that I thought I could improve myself, so I wanted to do it myself.
